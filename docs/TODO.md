# TODO
- Chords
  - Select a drone note and key via seeded PRNG
  - Drone note is present in all chords (any MIDI note between C4 and C5)
  - Calculate all chords with harmonics containing the drone note
  - Essentially, where it is the root, third, fifth, or ninth
  - Determine chord via noise field choosing from this mapping
- Chunk generation
  - Noise field for chunk density
  - Note selection via chord module
- Drones
  - Determine nearest notes via spawner and spawn them
- Movement
  - Controls
  - Movement model
  - Footstep synths
- Props
  - Note selection and spawning
- Wind
  - Radial noise field, in 3D (sin(atan2(y, x)), distance(x, y), time)
  - Spanwer frequency
  - Synth
